In the 3rd week of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program, we were given a week to create and deploy a game.

// list requirements.

I didn't want to use a framework because I wanted to challenge myself to build the whole thing from the ground up.

I wanted something that was different and a bit more challenging than the examples given of projects that were done in the past.

I chose cribbage. Cribbage is a card game with many phases and many rules that change depending on what is happening.

I was familiar with the game having played it quite often as a kid, so I knew what I was getting into...sort of.

I ended up breaking everything down in to more and more granular chunks starting with the scoring.  There's no point to a game if you can't see how well you are doing.  I wanted to make sure I could tackle and get the algorithms needed to properly score the hands before I went any further.  If I couldn't get that proof of concept done within the first day, I would still have time left over to switch to something else that I would be able to complete.  It took 5 hours of whiteboarding and research to get 2 functions written that I understood what they were doing and why.  I had to get more familiar with bitwise operators to make the tests to find all possible combinations of cards and if they satisfied the conditions of scoring.
