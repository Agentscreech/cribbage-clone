Cribbage
========

### Background

This is the first week long project for General Assembly Web Development Immersive.

After 2 weeks of instruction, we had to build a front end game.

I didn't want to use a framework because I wanted to challenge myself to build the whole thing from the ground up.

I wanted something that was different and a bit more challenging than the examples given of projects that were done in the past.

I chose cribbage. Cribbage is a card game with many phases and many rules that change depending on what is happening.

I was familiar with the game having played it quite often as a kid, so I knew what I was getting into...sort of.

### Usage

Don't know how to play?  Read up on the [rules](http://www.cribbage.org/rules/)

Ultra basic description is you play cards and they get scored.  First to 121 wins.

Clone the repository and then open the index.html file or go to [my live site](http://www.traviswalentin.com/cribbage-clone).

Click on the card to start the game and follow the instructions in the center green bar in between the 2 scores.

### Technologies

Basic HTML, CSS , Javascript with jQuery

### Known Issues

* There still exists a bug where if you play to quickly at just the right time, the scoring process runs twice.

* Certain plays don't fire the proper scoring algorithms.

### Future additions

* Redesign would include a basic start up modal and then a scoring modal with a next button when the player is ready to see the next screen.

* Update styling so it looks a little better.
